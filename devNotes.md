**NOTE : For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

public/index.html is the page template;
src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.
You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside src. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by Webpack. You need to put any JS and CSS files inside src, otherwise Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside public can be used from public/index.html.
